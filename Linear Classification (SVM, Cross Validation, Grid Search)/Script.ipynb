    "# Introduction (35pts)\n",
    "In this notebook, you will classify emails as either spam or not spam using support vector machines. The full dataset consists 80k labeled emails. The labels are 1 if they are ham (not spam), and -1 if they are spam. The lines of the emails have already been slightly processed, such that different words are space delimited, however little other processing has occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary notes\n",
    "1. You can not use scikit-learn. \n",
    "2. For this notebook, each proceeding part depends on the previous since we are building up a moderately sized data science pipeline. Verify your previous parts before proceeding onto the next. \n",
    "3. Similar the linear regression notebook of the previous assignment, you will need to use the tfidf function from the natural language processing notebook. You can download your notebook as a module and import it. If you're in 388 or you find that your implementation is too slow, copy the reference solution (its only 10 lines). \n",
    "4. As we move into more advanced algorithms and techniques, there will be more introductions of randomness. This means that some of the example outputs in the notebook contain some randomness, and will probably not match your results exactly. Verify your code by checking your properties/invariants or feeding in static inputs for which you can calculate the output. \n",
    "5. When writing pickle files to be read into Autolab, **write files with the binary flag**\n",
    "5. There is another contest at the end of this notebook. "

    "## SVM classification (15pts)\n",
    "Recall the support vector machine (SVM) from slide 17 of linear classification. Since it is such a straightforward algorithm, you will implement it below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "* 2pts - correct objective\n",
    "* 5pts - correct gradient\n",
    "* 8pts - correct prediction after training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifications\n",
    "1. If you do not use matrix operations, your code will be **very slow**. Every function in here can be implemented in 1 or 2 lines using matrix equations, and the only for loop you need is the training loop for gradient descent. **If your code is slow here, it will be extremely slow in the next section when doing parameter search**.\n",
    "2. You should train your SVM using gradient descent as described in the slides. Your objective value should also mimic that of the slides. \n",
    "3. Since this is a convex function, your gradient steps should always decrease your objective. A simple check when writing these optimization procedures is to print your objectives and verify that this is the case (or plot them with matplotlib).\n",
    "4. You can also use scipy.optimize.check_grad to numerically verify the correctness of your gradients. \n",
    "5. For the unlikely boundary case where your hypothesis outputs 0, we will treat that as a positive prediction. \n",
    "6. Be careful of numpy.matrix objects which are constrained to always have dimension 2 (scipy operations will sometimes return this instead of an ndarray). "

    "2. For each of the remaining k parts, we train the model on k-1 parts and validate our model on the heldout part. \n",
    "3. This gives k results, and the average of these runs gives the final result\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that by holding out part of the dataset as validation data, we can train and measure our generalization ability. Note the key fact here: the training does not see the validation data at all, which is why it measures generalization! Randomizing the groups removes bias from ordering (i.e. if these results occurred in chronological order, we don't want to train on only Monday's results to predict on Wednesday's results), and averaging over the groups reduces the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will use classification error rate as our result metric (so the fraction of times in which our model returns the wrong answer). Calculating this value via k-fold cross validation gives us a measure of how well our model generalizes to new data (lower error rate is better). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification\n",
    "1. Break the examples in k+1 groups as follows: \n",
    "    * break the permutation into blocks of size $\\text{ceil}\\left(\\frac{n}{k+1}\\right)$ (the last block may be shorter than the rest)\n",
    "    * set aside the k+1th group as the testing block, and use the remaining k blocks for cross validation\n",
    "    * use the permutation as indices to select the rows that correspond to that block\n",
    "    * Example: k=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5,6] sets aside [5,6] as the test set, and break the remaining permutation into [[1,3],[2,4]] so the blocks of data for validation are X[[1,3],:] and X[[2,4],:]\n",
    "    * the order of the indices in the blocks should match the order in the original permutation\n",
    "2. For each group k, train the model on all other datapoints, and compute the error rate on the held-out group. \n",
    "3. Return the average error rate over all k folds, along \n",
